## Development Setup


## Coding Guidelines

- Follow the **Clean Architecture** principles.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write comments to explain complex logic.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Lint your code before create a pull request.
- Follow the C++ Core Guidelines where applicable.

---

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Use **Catch2**.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

Example test with Catch2:
```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include "catch.hpp"
#include "domain/entities/Repository.hpp"

TEST_CASE("Repository entity", "[repository]") {
    Repository repo{"test-repo", "https://github.com/user/test-repo", "A test repository", false};
    REQUIRE(repo.name == "test-repo");
    REQUIRE(repo.url == "https://github.com/user/test-repo");
}
```

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Fix bug" instead of "Fixes bug").
- Keep the subject line under 50 characters.
- Provide a detailed body if necessary, explaining the "why" and "how" of the change.
- Follow the [conventional guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

Example:
```
